Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Terracoin Core (on Mac)
or terracoind/terracoin-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.0

Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every
fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with
pre-0.12 versions of Terracoin Core or other software.

If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,
you will need to reindex when you first start Terracoin Core version 0.11 or
earlier.

Notable changes
===============

Insight
-------

The most notable changes are the ones made for insight, a new utility
`wallet-utility` will be included in the utils build.  Also how transactions
are indexed has changed.  A `reindex` is not required, but it is encouraged to
index these changes.

Miscellaneous
-------------

Icons have all changed to be more consistent and the main background image was
changed to make more of the client more visible, also we have a new splash
screen, Enjoy!

Added `-debuglogfile` option which allows you to specified an absolute or
relative file for the debug.log.  This will allow you to put it and name it as
you'd like.  By default everything will stay the same.
